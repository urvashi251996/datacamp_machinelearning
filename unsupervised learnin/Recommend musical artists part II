Suppose you were a big fan of Bruce Springsteen - which other musicial artists might you like? 
Use your NMF features from the previous exercise and the cosine similarity to find similar musical artists.
A solution to the previous exercise has been run, so norm_features is an array containing the normalized NMF features as rows. 
The names of the musical artists are available as the list artist_names.
/code
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Create a DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(norm_features,index=artist_names)

# Select row of 'Bruce Springsteen': artist
artist = df.loc['Bruce Springsteen']

# Compute cosine similarities: similarities
similarities = df.dot(artist)

# Display those with highest cosine similarity
print(similarities.nlargest())
