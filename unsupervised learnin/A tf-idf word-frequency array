In this exercise, you'll create a tf-idf word frequency array for a toy collection of documents. 
For this, use the TfidfVectorizer from sklearn. It transforms a list of documents into a word frequency array, which it outputs as a csr_matrix. 
It has fit() and transform() methods like other sklearn objects.

You are given a list documents of toy documents about pets. Its contents have been printed in the IPython Shell.

///code

# Import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Create a TfidfVectorizer: tfidf
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer()

# Apply fit_transform to document: csr_mat
csr_mat = tfidf.fit_transform(documents)

# Print result of toarray() method
print(csr_mat.toarray())

# Get the words: words
words = tfidf.get_feature_names()
# Print words
print(words)
