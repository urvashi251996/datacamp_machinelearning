n this exercise, you'll visualize the decision boundaries of various classifier types.

A subset of scikit-learn's built-in wine dataset is already loaded into X, along with binary labels in y.

//code
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Define the classifiers
classifiers = [LogisticRegression(),LinearSVC(),SVC(),KNeighborsClassifier()]

# Fit the classifiers
for c in classifiers:
    c.fit(X,y)

# Plot the classifiers
plot_4_classifiers(X, y, classifiers)
plt.show()
